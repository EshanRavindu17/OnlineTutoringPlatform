# Reviews & Ratings Feature - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 Feature Overview
A complete reviews and ratings system for Mass Tutors to view student feedback organized by class.

## ✅ What Was Built

### Backend (Node.js + Prisma)

1. **Service Layer** (`massTutor.service.ts`)
   - `getTutorReviewsService()` - Fetches all reviews for tutor's classes
   - Groups reviews by class
   - Calculates statistics (average rating, review count per class)
   - Returns reviews sorted by date (most recent first)

2. **Controller Layer** (`massTutor.controller.ts`)
   - `getTutorReviewsController()` - Handles HTTP requests
   - Authenticates tutor
   - Returns structured JSON response

3. **Routes** (`massTutor.routes.ts`)
   - `GET /mass-tutor/reviews` - Endpoint to fetch reviews

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

1. **API Client** (`massTutorAPI.ts`)
   - `getReviews()` - Fetches reviews from backend

2. **Component** (`Reviews&Ratings.tsx`)
   - **Summary Cards**: Total Reviews, Average Rating, Classes with Reviews
   - **Reviews by Class**: Expandable/collapsible cards per class
   - **Review Details**: Shows rating, review text, student name, date
   - **Professional UI**: Gradient headers, star ratings, avatars

3. **Navigation**
   - Added "Reviews" to sidebar (yellow star icon)
   - Route: `/mass-tutor/reviews`
