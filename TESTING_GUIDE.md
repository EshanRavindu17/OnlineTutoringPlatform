## 🔧 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Frontend** calls `/payment/create-payment-intent-mass` with:
   ```json
   {
     "studentId": "f4832651-f7ff-4466-a19a-87d83f27223e",
     "classId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
     "amount": 5000
   }
   ```

2. **Stripe** processes the payment with test card

3. **Frontend** calls `/payment/confirm-payment-mass` with:
   ```json
   {
     "paymentIntentId": "pi_xxx",
     "studentId": "f4832651-f7ff-4466-a19a-87d83f27223e",
     "classId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
     "amount": 5000
   }
   ```

4. **Backend** creates enrollment and payment records

## 📱 Testing in Real Class Page

1. Go to any mass class page: `/mass-class/:classId`
2. If not enrolled, click "Enroll Now"
3. Complete payment process
4. Page refreshes with enrollment status

## 🔍 Console Logs to Watch

## ⚠️ Known Issues

If you see backend errors related to `customer_id`, this is a schema issue that doesn't affect the payment flow testing. The payment component will still work for demonstration purposes.
