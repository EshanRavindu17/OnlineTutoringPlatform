### **Email Service Functions Added:**

```typescript
// Session completion notification
sendSessionCompletionEmail(
  to: string,
  type: 'student' | 'tutor',
  studentName: string,
  tutorName: string,
  sessionDate: string,
  sessionTime: string,
  sessionSubject?: string,
  sessionDuration?: string,
  amount?: number
)

// Auto-cancellation notification
sendAutoCancellationEmail(
  to: string,
  type: 'student' | 'tutor',
  studentName: string,
  tutorName: string,
  sessionDate: string,
  sessionTime: string,
  sessionSubject?: string,
  refundAmount?: number
)
```

### **How the Notification Flow Works:**

#### **Manual Session Completion:**
1. **Tutor clicks "Complete Session"** in dashboard
2. **Backend processes completion**:
   - Updates session status to "completed"
   - Sets end_time timestamp
   - Retrieves student and tutor information
3. **Sends emails automatically**:
   - Email to student (completion confirmation + review encouragement)
   - Email to tutor (completion confirmation + payment info)
4. **Returns success** with updated session data

#### **Automatic Session Expiry (Auto-Cancellation):**
1. **Background service runs every 5 minutes** (SessionCleanupService)
2. **Checks for sessions past grace period**:
   - Scheduled sessions that ended >15 minutes ago
   - Tutor never started the session
3. **Processes auto-cancellation**:
   - Updates session status to "canceled"
   - Updates payment status to "refund"
   - Gets student, tutor, and payment information
4. **Sends emails automatically**:
   - Email to student (apology + refund confirmation)
   - Email to tutor (policy violation warning)

#### **Automatic Session Completion:**
1. **Background service runs every 10 minutes** (SessionCleanupService)
2. **Checks for long-running sessions**:
   - Ongoing sessions that started >1 hour ago
3. **Processes auto-completion**:
   - Updates session status to "completed"
   - Sets end_time timestamp
4. **Sends emails automatically**:
   - Email to student (completion confirmation)
   - Email to tutor (completion + payment processing)

### **Email Template Features:**

#### **Professional Design:**
- ðŸ“§ **Consistent Branding**: Using Tutorly email template system

- **Professional Tone**: Apologetic for issues, encouraging for completions

### **Backend Integration Points:**

  sendSessionCancellationEmail,

  sendAutoCancellationEmail 
} from './email.service';

getSessionTimeRange(slots: (string | Date)[]): string

```

```

- **Graceful Degradation**: Session operations succeed even if emails fail
- **Retry Logic**: Built into SendGrid service

#### **Data Consistency:**
