# Session Cancellation with Payment Refund - Implementation Guide

## What was implemented:

### Backend Changes:

1. **Updated Session Service** (`backend/src/services/sessionService.ts`):
   - Modified `requestSessionCancellation` function to handle both session status update and payment refund
   - Added transaction to ensure data consistency
   - Updates session status to "canceled"
   - Updates individual_payment status to "refund"
   - Notifies student about cancellation and refund
   - Frees up tutor time slots

### Frontend Changes:

1. **Updated SessionActions Component** (`frontend/src/pages/individualTutor/SessionActions.tsx`):

   - Changed sessionId type from `number` to `string` to match backend UUID
   - Enhanced cancellation warning message to show refund information
   - Lists all actions that will be taken when cancellation is requested

2. **Updated Tutor Dashboard** (`frontend/src/pages/individualTutor/tutorDashboard.tsx`):
   - Imported and integrated SessionActions component
   - Added state management for SessionActions modal
   - Updated Session interface to use string ID and include status field
   - Replaced simple "Request Cancellation" button with "Session Actions" button
   - Added handlers for cancellation and future reschedule functionality

## How it works:

1. **User clicks "Session Actions" button** in tutor dashboard
2. **SessionActions modal opens** showing session details and options
3. **User selects "Cancel Session"** and provides reason
4. **System processes cancellation** by:
   - Updating session status to "canceled" in database
   - Updating payment status to "refund" in individual_payments table
   - Sending notification to student
   - Freeing up tutor's time slots
   - Showing success message to tutor

## Database Changes:

The system now properly handles the payment refund process:

- **Sessions table**: `status` = 'canceled'
- **Individual_Payments table**: `status` = 'refund'

## Testing Steps:

1. Login as a tutor
2. Navigate to Sessions tab in dashboard
3. Find an upcoming session
4. Click "Session Actions" button
5. Click "Cancel Session"
6. Provide a reason for cancellation
7. Confirm cancellation
8. Verify:
   - Session shows as cancelled in dashboard
   - Payment status is updated to refund in database
   - Student receives notification about refund

## API Endpoint Used:

```
POST /api/sessions/:firebaseUid/session/:sessionId/cancel
Body: { "reason": "Optional cancellation reason" }
```

## Future Enhancements:

- Implement reschedule functionality in SessionActions component
- Add email notifications for refunds
- Add refund tracking and reporting features
- Implement different refund policies based on cancellation timing
