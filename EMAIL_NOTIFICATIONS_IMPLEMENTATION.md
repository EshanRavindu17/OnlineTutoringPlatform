# Session Cancellation Email Notifications - Implementation

## ‚úÖ **Email Notifications Added Successfully**

### **What was implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Session Cancellation Service** - Updated `requestSessionCancellation` in `sessionService.ts`:

   - ‚úÖ Sends email to **student** about session cancellation and refund
   - ‚úÖ Sends email to **tutor** about session cancellation confirmation
   - ‚úÖ Uses existing professional email templates
   - ‚úÖ Includes all session details (date, time, amount, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Handles email failures gracefully (doesn't break cancellation process)

2. **Email Content Details:**
   - **Student Email**:
     - Apologizes for inconvenience
     - Confirms refund amount and processing time (3-5 business days)
     - Shows session details that were cancelled
   - **Tutor Email**:
     - Confirms cancellation was processed
     - Shows session details
     - Professional notification about the action taken

### **How the flow works:**

1. **User clicks "Confirm Cancellation"** in SessionActions modal
2. **Backend processes cancellation**:
   - Updates session status to "canceled"
   - Updates payment status to "refund"
   - Frees up tutor time slots
   - Creates notification records
3. **Sends emails automatically**:
   - Email to student (cancellation + refund notice)
   - Email to tutor (cancellation confirmation)
4. **Returns success message** mentioning emails were sent

### **Email Template Features:**

- üìß **Professional Design**: Using existing Tutorly email templates
- üí∞ **Refund Information**: Automatically includes refund amount
- üìÖ **Session Details**: Date, time, tutor/student names
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear Messaging**: Appropriate for both student and tutor perspectives
- üîí **Error Handling**: Email failures don't break the cancellation process

### **Backend Changes Made:**

1. **Added email service import**: `import { sendSessionCancellationEmail } from "./email.service"`
2. **Enhanced cancellation function**: Added email sending logic after database transaction
3. **Improved error handling**: Email errors are logged but don't affect cancellation success
4. **Updated success message**: Now mentions that emails were sent

### **Testing Steps:**

1. Login as tutor ‚Üí Go to Sessions ‚Üí Select upcoming session
2. Click "Session Actions" ‚Üí "Cancel Session" ‚Üí "Confirm Cancellation"
3. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Session status changed to "canceled" in database
   - ‚úÖ Payment status changed to "refund" in database
   - ‚úÖ Student receives cancellation email with refund info
   - ‚úÖ Tutor receives cancellation confirmation email
   - ‚úÖ Success message mentions emails were sent

### **Email Service Dependencies:**

- **SendGrid**: Used for email delivery (API key required in environment)
- **Email Templates**: Professional HTML templates with Tutorly branding
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if email service is unavailable

### **Security & Reliability:**

- ‚úÖ **Database Transaction**: Ensures data consistency
- ‚úÖ **Email After DB**: Emails only sent after successful database update
- ‚úÖ **Error Isolation**: Email failures don't rollback successful cancellation
- ‚úÖ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
